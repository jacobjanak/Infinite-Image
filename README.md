**The Problem:**

You have a beautiful image which should stretch across your entire page, without actually stretching. Stretching an image distorts it.

This can be difficult, especially since some people use extremely wide monitors.

You would have to find an image that is 2000px+ wide and 300px tall (or however tall you want it). Images with an aspect ratio that crazy don't exist and, if they did, they would take forever to load.

**The Solution:**

Take your beautiful image and duplicate it until it covers the width of the page.

To make it look like a single, huge image, we must horizontally flip every other image.
